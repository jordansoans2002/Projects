		<h2 style="color: red;">My beliefs</h2>
		<div class="me">I believe Jesus is God and the only way to God. I base my identity on who God is and this is what shapes me and who I am. My goal in life is to be like Jesus and make Him known. I spend a lot of my thoughts trying to know what God wants me to do. God's will is the most important thing to me. I know Jesus is coming back soon and I will have to give account to Him so I want to do the best I can for Him.</div>
